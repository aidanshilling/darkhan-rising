							<p>
								The Empire is the last standing contender in the political war against the wizards of Zuros. The have

						<h4>Fjoll</h4>
						<div class="container">
							<p>

					<li>
						<h4>Kide</h4>

							<p>
								Land of the northern Humans and ancient Dwarves. The Dwarves have been exiled from society and keep to
								their caves underground. They have a neutrality pact with the Republic. There are many monestaries here,
								inhabited by some rather... unruly monks.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div><b>Capital</b>: Krast</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Ardon</h4>
						<div class="container">
							<p>
								Once inhabited by the ancient races of Orc's, tieflings and others. As the humans and elves expanded,
								many of these races were killed off in horrible wars. This land has never really fit into society well,
								but is currently inhabited by mostly working class humans, elves and half elves. There is a lot of
								industry influence from the Empire here, even though it's technically in the republic's sphere of
								influence.

						<h4>Thorval</h4>
						<div class="container">
							<p>
								A free nation for Warlocks and Worshipers alike. Many god fearing peoples were ostricied from society
								during the Mage Crusades centuries ago. Under the protection of the Darkhan Empire, Thorval was formed.
								Thorval is a hub for worshipers of all kinds. You can find a temple for just about everyone here and
								somehow the peace remains.

						<h4>Other Locations</h4>
						<ul>
							<ol>
								<h5>Dunadal</h5>
								<div class="container">
									The hub city of the Drow. When the Zuros mages were on their quest for power, the Drow were often cast
									aside. While all of Elven kind can trace thier origins to Fjoll in some way, they drow have had a hard
									time finding their place in the world. Shortly after the creation of the Free Nation of Thorval,
									Dunadal was formed deep beneath the city of dieties.
